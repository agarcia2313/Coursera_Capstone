Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

#### This submission will eventually become your Introduction/Business Problem section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your Introduction/Business Problem section only for now) to your Github repository and submit a link to it.

#### The problem that is to be solved is where in Toronto is the best neighborhood to live in based on population and average income of the area. Other factors to take into account are what kind of ammenties, shops, or resturants are in the area.
#### Using poplutation information will tell the client if the area is too crowded or less crowded which may lead to more space or land to purchase. Average income of a neighborhood may tell the client what type of residents live there as well as what kind of homes may be avaliable as higher income neighborhoods may have better homes avaliable and safer neighborhoods. Foursquare would provide information on what kind of ammenties, shops, and resturants are in the area that our client may want to visit regularly if they were to choose that neighborhood.
