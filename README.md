## Business Problem

Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

#### The problem that is to be solved by our application is where is the best neighbhorhood in Toronto for our clients or stakeholders to move into based on what amenties are located nearby.

#### Toronto is considered one of the most popular cities in Canada. Many people make the decision to move there every year to different neighbhorhoods for a variety of reasons. A number of the existing popluation even choose to move to different places within the city for various reasons. By utilizing FourSquare location data, we will be able to segment and cluster neighborhoods together and collect data on what amenties are in each neighborhood. By collecting type and frequency of venues nearby, the client or stakeholder will be able to determine where they think is the best place for them to move. As apart of a larger question to be solved, many choose their residence based on what is nearby making this application useful to those looking to move to a neighborhood close to their favorite businesses or places.
